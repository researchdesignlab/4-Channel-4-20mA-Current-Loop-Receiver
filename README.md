4 Channel 4-20mA Current Loop receiver offers a solution for applications in which it is necessary to measure sensors with 4mA to 20mA output with high precision and resolution.
There is a large number of sensors with output ranging from 4mA to 20mA available on the market (they are commonly called transmitters). The most common ones are the pressure sensor, the temperature sensor, the humidity sensor, among others. Sensors with output ranging from 4mA to 20mA are largely used in industrial processes.

# Features:

* Measurement of up to 4 sensors per module.
* Low Current Consumption: 150 Î¼A
* I2C Interface: Four Pin-Selectable Addresses.
* Wide Supply Range: 2.0 V to 5.5 V
* 860 samples per second.
